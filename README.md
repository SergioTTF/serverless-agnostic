# serverless-agnostic
A Serverless Framework Plugin to build provider agnostic serverless express.js applications.

## 1. Installation

Run `npm install` in your Serverless project.

```bash
npm install --save-dev serverless-agnostic
```

Add the plugin to your serverless.yml file

```yml
plugins:
  - serverless-agnostic
```

## 2. Configuration
In order to use *serverless-agnostic* there should be one main `.serverless` configuration file for the plugin settings and one yaml file for each provider, in this provider yaml files there should be all Serverless Framework configuration required for that specific provider. The suggested name pattern for these files is `.serverless-{{PROVIDER_NAME}}.yml`.

      ├── .serverless-gcp.yml         # GCP serverless config file
      ├── .serverless-aws.yml         # AWS serverless config file
      └── .serverless                 # main serverless config file
### Plugin Setup
The main `.serverless` file should have the plugin specific variables declared in the custom attributes section, under the `serverlessAgnostic` object.

Here's an example of a `.serverless` file:
```yml
custom:
  serverlessAgnostic:
    serverFile: index.js
    handlerName: myHandler
    serverName: app
    providers:
      - name: aws
        slsFilePath: serverless.aws.yml
      - name: gcp
        slsFilePath: serverless.gcp.yml
```

## 3. Commands

### Compile
The compile command its very straight foward, it compiles your code into the format accepted by the providers you specified in the `providers` attribute. The default behavior is to compile for all providers, but if you want to compile for one or more specific providers than you can user the `--provider` or `-p` flag. The generated files will be stored inside a file called `.serverless-agnostic`.

#### For all providers
```bash
serverless compile
```
#### For specific providers
```bash
serverless compile --provider aws
```

### Agnostic Deploy
The agnostic deploy command executes the Serverless Framework deploy for each provider declared, using the configuration described in the provider specific yaml files. The default behavior is to compile for all providers, but if you want to deploy for one or more specific providers than you can user the `--provider` or `-p` flag.

#### For all providers
```bash
serverless agnosticDeploy
```
#### For specific providers
```bash
serverless agnosticDeploy --provider gcp
```
